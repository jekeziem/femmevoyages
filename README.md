a SQL Database project for managing travel bucket list and related information.
This project was created as part of my course requirements, and it represents a comprehensive Travel Bucket List Management System using SQL. The system manages users, locations, bucket list items, completed trips, reviews, and associated costs. It also provides functionality for querying the number of completed trips for a user and fetching users with multiple completed trips.
Project Context
As someone who travels regularly and has a deep passion for solo travel, I chose this project specifically to align with my personal interests. I often plan my trips based on specific experiences I want to check off my list, whether itâ€™s visiting iconic landmarks or trying unique activities in various locations. This project aims to manage and track such aspirations.
Given my interest in keeping detailed records of my travels and the necessity of maintaining an organized and easily accessible list of potential destinations, I felt the idea of a travel bucket list database would be both personally useful and cool.
Key Features
Users: Each traveler can maintain their profile.
Locations: A catalog of countries and cities to visit.
Bucket List Items: Track specific travel goals related to each location.
Completed Trips: Record the trips completed and when they were accomplished.
Reviews and Ratings: Users can rate their experiences and leave reviews.
Cost Information: Maintain an overview of the costs for different activities associated with each bucket list item.
Technologies Used
SQL: Used for database management, creating tables, inserting records, and querying data.
MySQL: The SQL database system chosen to handle this data.
Future Enhancements (knowing what I know now)
User Authentication: Add user authentication for a more personalized experience.
Integration with Travel APIs: Pull live data for locations, flights, and costs.
Web Interface: Develop a front-end for easier interaction with the database.
